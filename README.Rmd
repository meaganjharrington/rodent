# epievolve

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of epievolve is to estimate time-varying Rt(t) using the odin-monty framework. Estimates Rt(t) from time series of case counts using a mechanistic SIR model. Enables interpretable inference on epidemic dynamics and intervention eff ects.

## Installation

You can install the development version of epievolve from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("meaganjharrington/epievolve")
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
